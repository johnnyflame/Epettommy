# Epettommy

A Tamagochi inspired smart watch app prototype, written in TypeScript.

The folder "emulator" contains the source code for the emulator itself.
For the application prototype code, see "prototype".
Test cases can be found under "Unit Tests" in the emulator index.html. 


To run the smart watch emulator, first compile and build all files (`gulp build`),
then run index.html under Site Root. 

## Other Gulp Tasks

** `gulp typedoc` will generate documentation from the code.
** `gulp tslint` will run tslint over the code.
** `gulp clean` will delete the directories of compiled code and generated documentation.
