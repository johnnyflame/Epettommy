A Tamagochi inspired smart watch app prototype

The folder "emulator" contains the source code for the emulator itself.
For the application prototype code, see "prototype".
Test cases can be found under "Unit Tests". 


To run the smart watch emulator, first compile and build all files (gulp build), then run index.html under Site Root.
